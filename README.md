REST Assignment #1
==================

> In this assignment you will be using Java Spring to begin working on
> a RESTful server.  For this assignment you will be a RESTful service
> to return a single String and also an array of String.  You must
> submit three Java files, the xxxApplication file, the xxxController
> and the Name class.  In the previous sentence, xxx is replaced with
> your choice of what you want to call the file/project.  The
> xxxApplication file is generated by IntelliJ. You must write the
> Controller with the appropriate methods.  This controller and its
> methpods must have the proper annotations to allow the server to
> function properly.
>
> The Name class needs to provide instance variables for the ID and
> name. ID will be an int and name a String.  Provide getters, setters
> and a no argument and two argument constructor.
>
> In the controller, you will be doing is writing two methods,
> getNames which will return a List of Name objects.  Second you will
> write a getName method which will take an int for the id and return
> the String for the associated Name object.  The getNames method
> should use an extension to the URI of names.  The getName method
> should use this same URI with addition of the id for the name that
> you want to retrieve, investigate the PathVariable annotation.
> Recommend in the controller that you initialize a list of Name
> objects, the name should be unique for each object.
>
> Your submission should include the following Java files,
> Application, Controller and Name.  Also you must include screenshots
> of your ARC or Postman results, one showing the list of names and
> one showing the single name.
